# libmpcalg
Model predictive control algorithms library in MATLAB/OCTAVE.

## How to use the library?
To use implemented algorithms in a script simply add the path to src directory
of the library.
```Matlab
    addpath('<path-to-libmpcalg>/libmpcalg/src');
```
After this line of code, constructors of regulators classes will be accessible.
For precise instructions about using specific algorithms see the list below.
